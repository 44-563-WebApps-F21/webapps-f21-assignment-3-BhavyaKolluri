        <h1>Karolina Dean</h1>
        <p1>She is a "freak" amongst the group, the only one who needs to actively hide her true form.
            Karolina is also shown as being quite sensitive, often crying at her pain and misfortune, 
            as well as the pain and misfortune of others.</p1>
